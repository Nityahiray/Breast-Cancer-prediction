# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project predicts whether a breast tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using machine learning. It uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset** and models like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **SVM**.

---

## Overview
Predicts breast cancer from tumor features (radius, texture, smoothness, etc.) using ML. Helps early detection and faster decision-making.

## Dataset 
- **File:** `dataset/breast_cancer.csv`  
- **Target:** `diagnosis` (M = Malignant, B = Benign)
